         I've always been quite passionate about technology, for me what really sparked my interest was
         video games at a young age. I am currently an aspiring software, currently focused on gaining more experience building
         web applications, front and backend, and also mobile application programming. I am also learning more about
         embedded programming and AI & ML.

         Besides programming, Im a huge fan of sports, especially basketball. I am also a big car enthusiast
         and love weightlifting and cycling to keep myself active.
